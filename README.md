# Ensemble-based-spam-filtering: Ensemble based spam filtering using machine learning methods

Machine learning techniques provide excellent results for spam filtering. 
But the performance may vary on different scenarios considering only one machine learning 
technique at a time. In this regard, I have designed a system which can classify spam email 
according to the majority voting from the resulting data using ensemble technique considering 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes and, Decision tree approaches jointly.

It was a course project where I was asked to generate the confusion matrix without using libraries.
The main target of that project was to study the different machine learning techniques.

You have to download the Enron Dataset before running this code.
